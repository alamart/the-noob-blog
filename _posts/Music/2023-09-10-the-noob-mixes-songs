Who would have thought that after all these years, I would have a DJ controller and would be mixing some songs.

## Background and early stages
My first DJ experience begins nearly 10 years ago with my first big nights out with my friends. One of them was an amateur DJ and before going to clubs, we would blast dancehall hits on the computer to get heat up and prepare to go. Happy days!
I always had a love to all kind of music, from classic genre, to latest edm songs, pop, r'n'b, reggae, dancehall, etc... When listening to DJs mixing west indian reggae dancehall, me and my friends often fantasized about what song could best come next in the mix and what could be the best way to introduce it. The Djs we listened, were judged on their ability to bring some sense of unique music point of view, their use of loops, samples, audacious cues, phrases and sounds combinations. Our energy level and our fun depended of all these elements. And we were quite judgemental, about the djs performances. In that context, a very good friend of mine decided to go semi pro DJ, living the dream of performing in front of hundreds of people, make them dance and happy. Obviously he then bought a DJ controller, and grinded on it to be ready to rule the night shows. At the time, I was not interested in handle the controller so I was looking for far away and just enjoy listening my friend's mixes.
Then years and years later, I was in my "Tomorrow land period", which means late july with nearly 2 weeks of the best DJ and producers settling in Belgium for the biggest DJ scenes in the world. Every day, I listened to the big names Martin Garrix, Steve Aoki, Hardwell, (Paris Hilton???). And then here comes James Hype. he litterally blew my mind with his original "Dancing x Sweet dreams x Love tonight" mix. The timing, the song choice, the acapella, the loop, everything was on point. And the crowd going crazy. I was hooked. 
With the curious and ingenious recommandation system of Youtube, I was quickly flooded with DJ material from big Dj channels like Crossfader, DJ Carlo ofr instance. That was it, I wanted to put my hand on platines and begin to scratch things.

## The controllers
I remembered I had an old and mini DJ Control MP3 e2 from  Hercules taking dust in my closet. I took it out and soon enough, I was able to plug it to my computer, download the DJUCED application and play my first song

You always hear these wonderful success stories about "How I made 50K in 2 weeks?", "How I played at high level in sports?", "How I landed my dream coding job in 6 months", etc... All these stories are great. But I simply prefer the saying :

```
It's not about the destination, It's about the journey
```
My main goals for this series of posts are to talking about my journey attempting new experiences.
You as an audience will have a big role in that process, as I expect hearing from you, if you are an expert in a topic I could discuss, a complete noob like myself, or just a curious chap wishingn to seek entertainment in somebody struggling in life as a noob.


Wrinting has never been a big part of my life. I'm more of a tech nerd than a library rat. Reading from other blog posts, I can see how it can be a fun activity and a way to express myself like no other.
Firstly I want to write because it is something new. I am at an age where I want to develop new skills and discover if I can be good in other things too. As much as I would love to have a natural talent in everything as quickly as a snap of fingers, this is impossible. In a sense, I find it quite depressing. In an other sense, being humble about it, I am not "Jarod" from The Pretender who can switch to any existing job on earth and be the best in the world at it.
On my part, my goal is to be the best version of myself and if writing can help accomplishing that then so be it. If not, I will switch to another great thing to do.

## Technicalities
In order to express myself, I was looking for a blog tool that is easy to access for me as an adminstrator, and maintainer, easy to publish with not much overthinking about web hosting. As it is an experiment, I try to be effective at the task without losing too much energy making the task. So after 2-3 hours of studying solutions to host and maintain my blog post, the choice was down to Medium, Github or my own self hosted website. I was thinking about domain names, costs, time to setting of everything, and then I switch it off and settled for GitHub pages tool.
All my articles will be stored publicly, I can sort them with minimum effort and start having a better idea about my content.
After creating a Github repository, all I needed to do was to follow a tutorial about the technicalities of launching that site. What I like about this first solution is that, th project is easily exportable, I will have no issue with potential scaling up or ramp-up access to the article. Moreover, I can go to Medium in a near future if find it interesting enough.

## What is at stake?
Going professional ? I do not think so. First because I need all my sleeping hours or else my existence would dangerously deteriorate. Second, I cannot imagine being in front on so many people, being judge, and being responsible for the fun of a large audience. Yeah terrific! No I pass. 
By being realistic, I do not know if my style is unique or interesting for an outside audience. But all I care is to see from where I am from to where I am going. So what is a stake is above all, learning, relaxing, improving from  an individual point of view and enjoy this process.
I hope it will help me realizing that I do evolve in life, I am not stagnating.

Next, you can expect multiple posts about different subjects, different experiences I had. For sure, I will learn a lot from this new experiences and I am looking forward to that. Being a noob is traditionally badly seen. But in my opinion as long as you keep improving even by failing, noobing is a great show of someone who has a curious mind, some kind of intelligence and humility.
