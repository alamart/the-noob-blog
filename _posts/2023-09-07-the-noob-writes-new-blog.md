Who would have thought that after all these years, my first blog article would be here. And yet what a noob I am.

You always hear these wonderful success stories about "How I made 50K in 2 weeks?", "How I played at high level in sports?", "How I landed my dream coding job in 6 months", etc... All these stories are great. But I simply prefer the saying :

`It's not about the destination, It's about the journey`

My main goals for this series of posts are to talk about my journey of attempting new experiences.
You as an audience will have a big role in that process, as I expect hearing from you, if you are an expert in a topic I could discuss, a complete noob like myself, or just a curious chap wishing to seek entertainment in somebody struggling in life as a noob.

## Motivation to write

Writing has never been a big part of my life. I am more of a tech nerd than a library rat. Reading from other blog posts, I can see how it can be a fun activity and a way to express myself like no other.
Firstly I want to write because it is something new. I am at an age where I want to develop new skills and discover if I can be good in other things too. As much as I would love to have a natural talent in everything as quickly as a snap of fingers, this is impossible. In a sense, I find it quite depressing. In an other sense, being humble about it, I am not "Jarod" from The Pretender who can switch to any existing job on earth and be the best in the world at it.
On my part, my goal is to be the best version of myself and if writing can help accomplishing that then so be it. If not, I will switch to another great thing to do.

## Technicalities

In order to express myself, I was looking for a blog tool that is easy to access for me as an adminstrator, and maintainer, easy to publish with not much overthinking about web hosting. As it is an experiment, I try to be effective at the task without losing too much energy making the task. So after 2-3 hours of studying solutions to host and maintain my blog post, the choice was down to Medium, Github or my own self hosted website. I was thinking about domain names, costs, time to setting of everything, and then I switch it off and settled for GitHub pages tool.
All my articles will be stored publicly, I can sort them with minimum effort and start having a better idea about my content.
After creating a Github repository, all I needed to do was to follow a tutorial about the technicalities of launching that site. What I like about this first solution is that, th project is easily exportable, I will have no issue with potential scaling up or ramp-up access to the article. Moreover, I can go to Medium in a near future if find it interesting enough. After 10 minutes, the stage was set.

## What is at stake?

By being realistic, I do not know if my style is unique or interesting for an outside audience. But all I care about is to see from where I am from to where I am going. So what is at stake is above all, learning, relaxing, improving from an individual point of view and enjoy this process.
I hope it will help me realizing that I do evolve in life, I am not stagnating.

Next, you can expect multiple posts about different subjects, different experiences I had. For sure, I will learn a lot from this new experiences and I am looking forward to that. Being a noob is traditionally badly seen. But in my opinion as long as you keep improving even by failing, noobing is a great show of someone who has a curious mind, some kind of intelligence and humility.
